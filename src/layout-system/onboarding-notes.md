# Onboarding Notes: Layout System Pattern

Welcome!  
This module is part of the **React Practice Series**, and here we explore how to build a slot-based layout system using **React + TypeScript**, designed for scalable UI architecture and editorial clarity.

---

## What you’ll learn

- Compose a page using named layout slots: `header`, `sidebar`, `main`, `footer`
- Pass components as props for flexible, declarative composition
- Use `LayoutContext` to enable layout-aware behavior (e.g. sidebar toggle)
- Build a layout that’s modular, teachable, and design-system-ready

This pattern treats layout as a system — not just a wrapper — and helps you separate visual responsibility from logic. It’s ideal for onboarding, design systems, and interview-ready architecture.

## Folder structure

Here’s how the folder is organized:

```
layout-system/
├── components/
│   ├── Layout.tsx         ← Orchestrates slot-based layout
│   ├── Header.tsx         ← Top navigation and branding
│   ├── Sidebar.tsx        ← Contextual navigation or filters
│   ├── Main.tsx           ← Primary content area
│   └── Footer.tsx         ← Legal links and visual closure
├── context/
│   └── LayoutContext.tsx  ← Shared layout-aware state (e.g. sidebar toggle)
├── LayoutApp.tsx          ← Demo entry for the module
└── onboarding-notes.md    ← This file

```

## How the layout flows

1. `Layout.tsx` receives slot components as props (`header`, `sidebar`, `main`, `footer`)
2. `LayoutContext` provides shared state (e.g. `isSidebarOpen`)
3. `LayoutApp.tsx` composes the layout using modular components
4. Each slot component is editorially named and visually scoped

This flow is declarative, scalable, and easy to teach or refactor.

---

## How you can extend it

- Add responsive behavior with Tailwind or media queries
- Make the sidebar route-aware using React Router
- Add theme toggling or design tokens via context
- Replace props with `children` if you prefer implicit composition

---

## Collaboration tips

- Keep slot components focused and visually scoped
- Use `ReactNode` for flexible composition
- Document the role of each slot in the layout system
- Treat layout as a system, not a wrapper — each part has a purpose

---

## Why this matters (interview-ready takeaways)

- Shows how you think in systems, not just components
- Demonstrates separation of concerns and editorial clarity
- Prepares you for scalable design systems and layout-aware architecture

## Comparing Patterns: What came before?

This module complements previous state and integration patterns. Here’s how it fits:

| Module            | Focus Area         | Ideal Use Case                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `state-patterns`  | Global state logic | Managing app-wide data and interactions |
| `api-integration` | External services  | Connecting to APIs with clarity         |
| **layout-system** | UI composition     | Structuring visual layout and slots     |
