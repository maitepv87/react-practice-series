# Onboarding Notes: API Integration Pattern

Welcome!
This module is part of the **React Practice Series**, and here we explore how to integrate external APIs using multiple protocols â€” REST, GraphQL, and WebSocket â€” with editorial clarity and scalable architecture.

---

## What youâ€™ll learn

- Create modular providers for different protocols
- Route requests through a centralized `integrationRouter.ts`
- Handle errors with empathy and clarity
- Build UI components that consume external data with fallback UX

This pattern teaches how to connect React components to real-world services while maintaining onboarding clarity and protocol fluency.

## Folder structure

Hereâ€™s how the folder is organized:

```

## How to add a new provider

1. Create the file inside `providers/` under the appropriate protocol folder
2. Export the function in `providers/index.ts`
3. Add the case to `integrationRouter.ts`
4. Add the option to `ProviderSelector.tsx`

Each provider should be editorially documented and include fallback UX.

---

## How to handle editorial errors

- Use clear and empathetic messages (`Could not retrieve data. Please try again.`)
- Avoid exposing raw technical errors to the end user
- Use `try/catch` in every provider and return a structured fallback

---

## How to scale

- **Authentication**: Add headers like `Authorization: Bearer ...`
- **Pagination**: Use `page`, `limit`, `offset` in REST or GraphQL
- **Multiple responses**: Transform arrays into readable lists or UI cards
- **Dynamic input**: Accept user prompts or filters to customize requests

---

## Collaboration tips

- Maintain modularity by protocol (`rest-fetch`, `graphql`, etc.)
- Document each provider with clarity and expected response shape
- Use `integrationRouter.ts` to centralize logic and reduce coupling
- Keep UI components clean and delegate logic to providers

---

## Why this matters (interview-ready takeaways)

- Shows how you handle real-world API integration with clarity
- Demonstrates protocol fluency and modular architecture
- Prepares you for scalable systems with authentication, pagination, and fallback UX

## Comparing Patterns: What came before?

This module complements previous state and layout patterns. Hereâ€™s how it fits:

| Module              | Focus Area         | Ideal Use Case                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `state-patterns`    | Global state logic | Managing app-wide data and interactions |
| **api-integration** | External services  | Connecting to APIs with clarity         |
| `layout-system`     | UI composition     | Structuring visual layout and slots     |
