# React Practice Series

A curated set of modular, documented React projects designed to reinforce technical depth, onboarding clarity, and strategic frontend architecture.

## Structure

- `state-patterns/`: State management examples including:

  - `useReducer + useContext`: Global state with reducer logic and context provider
  - `Redux Toolkit`: Scalable state slices, async thunks, and store configuration
  - `Zustand`: Lightweight state management with custom hooks
  - `TanStack Query`: Data fetching, caching, and background updates

- `ts-testing/`: TypeScript patterns (discriminated unions, generics) and UI testing with Jest and React Testing Library

- `layout-system/`: Slot-based layout architecture, shared contexts, and design system foundations

- `ai-integration/`: Components consuming AI APIs (e.g., text/image generation) with fallback UX and loading boundaries

- `performance-a11y/`: Performance audits (Lighthouse), memoization, lazy hydration, and accessibility patterns (ARIA, keyboard nav)

Each folder includes teachable components, onboarding notes, and defendable patterns for interviews and collaboration.
